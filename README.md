# baseball_widget

Simple widget to display scoring plays of my fantasy baseball players so I can get context of the RBIs and Runs scored.
I want to know if that RBI was a hard hit double or a ground out to short.

Python
Uses https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI for retrieving stats
Uses PySimpleGUI to display the plays
